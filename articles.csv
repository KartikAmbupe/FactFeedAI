Forty years on, he wants to build a fleet of them to clean up the oceans</p><p>John Todd remembers the moment he knew he was really on to something: “There was no question that it was at the Harwich dump in 1986,” he recalls. This was in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, close to where Todd still lives. Hidden away from the picturesque beaches was the town landfill, including lagoons of toxic waste from septic tanks, which was being left to seep into the groundwater below. So Todd, then a 45-year-old biologist, decided to design a solution. What he was “on to”, he came to realise, was not just a natural way of removing pollution from water, it was a holistic approach to environmental restoration that was way ahead of its time, and possibly still is.</p><p>An early eco-machine purifying toxic waste on Cape Cod in 1986.

813,Fantasy To Figurine: I Turned Myself Into An Action Figure Using ChatGPT — Here's How You Can Too,"Okay, I’ll admit it — I wasn’t expecting this to work as well as it did. But after seeing people turn their selfies into what looked like premium collectible action figures online, I had to try it for myself. And let me tell you, the results were wildly impressive.I’m talking blister-pack style packaging, lifelike facial features, custom outfits, accessories — the whole works. All generated with the help of ChatGPT’s latest model. If you’ve ever dreamed of seeing yourself as a superhero, space explorer, time-travelling detective, or a rockstar (like yours truly) now’s your moment. And the best part? You don’t need design skills or fancy tools — just a photo and a little creativity.So here’s a quick guide to creating your own custom action figure using ChatGPT. Trust me, it’s addictive.What You’ll Need to Get StartedFirst things first — open the ChatGPT app or head over to the official website. I experimented with the GPT-4o model on ChatGPT Plus for the best results, but if you're on the free plan, you can still generate up to three images per day.Then upload a clear photo of yourself. A front-facing shot with good lighting works best. Once that’s in, it’s all about the prompt — and this is where the magic happens.Prompt Ideas That Worked for MeYou can go basic or go big, but here are a few creative prompts I used that turned out really well:“Create a hyper-realistic action figure of me as a legendary rock guitarist. The package should show that this toy is a part of limited-edition Legends collection. Package should look like a retro collectible with bold fonts and clean design.”“Design a figure of me as an interdimensional explorer with glowing armor, a sci-fi blaster, and a robotic companion. The packaging should look futuristic, with holographic effects.”“Make me a 90s action hero — sunglasses, leather jacket, walkman on the belt. Add a cassette tape and retro cellphone inside the blister pack.”Feel free to tweak your own version based on your personality, profession, or just pure imagination. The more specific and fun you get, the better the results.The Fun Part: Seeing Yourself On A ShelfOnce you hit enter, ChatGPT works its magic. Within seconds, you’ll see a high-quality image of your action figure — perfectly posed and packaged. I honestly did a double-take when I saw mine. It looked like something straight out of a collector’s convention.You can download the image, share it with friends, or go back in and refine it. I even tried a few “alternate universe” versions of myself — one as a medieval bard, another as a cyberpunk vigilante. It’s dangerously fun.You NEED To Try ThisIf you’ve been scrolling past these AI-generated action figures and wondering what the fuss is about — just try it. It’s a mix of creativity, nostalgia, and pure digital joy. And with how easy it is to do through ChatGPT, it’s one of the coolest ways I’ve used AI lately.Now excuse me while I go make one of myself as a space DJ with a laser turntable.

919,"Global Times: Translators' Voices: China's diplomatic philosophy paves 'road of hope' for people of two nations, says former advisor to Cambodian Senate","BEIJING, April 21, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- ""At present, China's relations with its neighboring countries are at their best in modern times, and are also entering a critical phase of deep linkage between the regional landscape and the world changes"" — the recent Central Conference on Work Related to Neighboring Countries held in Beijing made such a profound judgment. Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia from April 14 to 18, highlighting the guiding role of head-of-state diplomacy in neighborhood relations. In the first volume of Xi Jinping: The Governance of China, President Xi emphasized that China's basic policy of diplomacy with neighboring countries is characterized by ""amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness."" In the third installment of the ""Decoding the Book of Xi Jinping: The Governance of China"" series, the Global Times continues to invite Chinese and international scholars, translators of the work, practitioners of its concepts, and overseas readers to share their insights, understandings and reflections on the ideas of China's neighborhood diplomacy, which emphasizes amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness, China's advocacy for building a community with a shared future with neighboring countries as well as its vision of creating a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable home. In the third installment of ""Translator's Voices"" column comprised of interviews with translators of the book series from various countries, GT reporter Hu Yuwei talked to Dr Chea Munyrith (Chea), president of the Cambodian Chinese Evolution Researcher Association and the former advisor to Cambodia's Senate, who shared how China's diplomatic philosophy inspires him to convey President Xi's wisdom to the Cambodian people. GT: Thank you for accepting the interview with the Global Times on decoding the book of Xi Jinping: The Governance of China. In a previous interview, you mentioned that you first read the book in a library in Beijing in 2014. Could you still recall the moment? What inspired you to translate the book? Chea: In December 2014, as the Cambodian Director of the Confucius Institute at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, I attended the Confucius Institute Annual Conference in Beijing. During that time, I came across the English version of the book. One article titled ""Work Together to Build the Silk Road Economic Belt"" deeply impressed me. The article states, ""We should expand regional cooperation with a more open mind and broader vision, and achieve joint progress."" Through the article, I understand that China is a major power which has always stood with developing countries. This becomes a driving force for my motivation to translate this great book and share the Chinese leader's wisdom with the Cambodian people. Therefore, upon returning home, I immediately recommended this book to the office of the Cabinet of Cambodia. The Royal Academy of Cambodia also attached great importance to it by establishing a translation working committee for the translation and promotion of the book in Khmer. I was fortunate to be involved in this effort. GT: You have served as the Cambodian Director of the Confucius Institute at the Royal Academy of Cambodia for eight years and are a well-known China expert. You once described the book of Xi Jinping: The Governance of China as ""a golden key to understanding China's development."" How do you interpret the ""Oriental Wisdom"" embedded in China's neighborhood diplomacy? How is the wisdom manifested in China-Cambodian exchanges? Chea: Peaceful diplomacy and opportunities for countries to stand shoulder to shoulder, standing on equality and win-win cooperation are the Chinese philosophy and the wisdom of President Xi. I believe China's neighborhood diplomacy philosophy profoundly embodies the ""Oriental Wisdom"" of ""harmonious coexistence."" It is mainly reflected in three dimensions. First is building a new form of international relations with the civilizational ethos of ""being kind to your neighbor."" China's diplomacy has always adhered to the principle of ""forging friendship and partnership with our neighbors,"" which stems from the traditional worldview of ""promoting harmony among all nations."" Second is deepening practical cooperation with the advocacy of ""valuing both righteousness and interests in shaping international relations."" In China-Cambodia cooperation, there are not only ""hard connectivity"" projects like the Chinese-invested Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway, but also ""soft connectivity"" achievements in education, healthcare, and poverty reduction. Third is guiding regional governance with the global sentiment of ""a shared future. From the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation mechanism to the building of an all-weather China-Cambodia community with a shared future in the new era, China has consistently practiced the ""Oriental Wisdom"": if you yourself desire rank and standing, then help others to get rank and standing. GT: President Xi pointed out in the first issue of the book series that ""China's basic policy of diplomacy with neighboring countries is to treat them as friends and partners, to foster an amicable, secure, and prosperous neighboring environment. This policy is characterized by amity, sincerity, mutual benefit, and inclusiveness."" You said that you carefully deliberated over the phrase ""amity, sincerity, mutual benefit, and inclusiveness"" during translation. How did you understand these four principles at the time? And how did you employ language to help Cambodian readers genuinely comprehend the wisdom behind China's diplomatic concept? Chea: China's diplomacy adheres to building relations with neighboring countries based on amity, sincerity, mutual benefit, and inclusiveness. Through translating the book series and reading Xi's important speeches, I have come to understand the meaning of these four words more clearly and translated them into Khmer to share with Cambodians. Amity involves good-neighborly interactions, mutual support and assistance, and frequent reciprocal visits, and is informed by equality, cultural affinity, and empathy. China contributes to stronger ties, and enhances the appeal of Cambodia and our region as a whole and its impact on world affairs. Sincerity is required in working with our neighbors. Both China and Cambodia, as well as the world as a whole need more friends and partners. Mutual benefit is the foundation on which China cooperates with its neighbors. China helps strengthen networks for Cambodia and those who share common interests, and enables China and Cambodia, as well as China's other neighbors to benefit from each other as they pursue their development strategies. Inclusiveness is indispensable to regional cooperation. Underpinned by the belief that the Asia-Pacific region is large enough to accommodate us all, it encourages open-mindedness as China works more proactively with the whole world toward shared goals. To ensure translation quality, the Royal Academy of Cambodia specially established an expert review panel comprising eight senior sinologists to rigorously examine the translated text. The translation process lasted six months, with three months dedicated to translation and another three months to proofreading. During this process, I felt particularly connected to Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu's famous quote that President Xi cited in the book: ""Governing a big country is as delicate as frying a small fish."" Cambodia has been profoundly influenced by Chinese philosophy and culture, particularly the teachings of Lao Tzu, Confucius, and Mencius. The literal meaning — that governing a nation is like frying a small fish in a pan — makes its profound wisdom immediately comprehensible to Cambodian readers. GT: On the 70th anniversary of the Bandung Conference, the ""Bandung Spirit"" characterized by ""seeking common ground while reserving differences, solidarity, friendship, and cooperation"" has once again sparked discussions. The concepts emphasized in the book, such as ""mutual benefit"" and ""common development,"" hold even greater relevance today. How do you interpret President Xi's statement in the book that ""we should advocate inclusiveness, stressing that there is enough room in the Asia-Pacific region for all countries to develop, and promoting regional cooperation with an open mind and enthusiasm""? Chea: Seventy years ago, at the Bandung Conference, China encouraged countries, especially those in the Global South, to unite as a force against all forms of war, and instead work together, unite, cooperate, mutually win, and learn from each other. The Chinese path to modernization has consistently demonstrated that development can be inclusive and non-confrontational. In the face of current geopolitical challenges in the Asia-Pacific region, the global governance concept of ""extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefit"" advocated by China carries particular practical significance. It's just like what President Xi put in the book: ""No global problem can be solved by any one country alone. There must be global action, global response, and global cooperation."" GT: On the recent Central Conference on Work Related to Neighboring Countries, it stated that ""at present, China's relations with its neighboring countries are at their best in modern times."" Do you agree with this assessment, and why? Chea: I do agree. President Xi is one of the most influential persons in this century, and this century can be called the Chinese century, the time when China has shown the world China's defense of the path that leads the world to common prosperity and win-win. As China's ""ironclad friend,"" Cambodia has gained tangible development benefits from its strategic alignment with China. In particular, the important consensus reached by the leaders of both countries on deepening the construction of a China-Cambodia community with a shared future in the new era has provided direction for advancing bilateral relations to a higher level and has brought the relationship between the two countries to its best historical period. I agree with the wisdom of Chinese President Xi, because through the study of Chinese history, we will clearly understand that China has developed from a poor and weak country to the second largest economy, but through the efforts of its people and the efforts of the entire nation to maintain peace. History has created these stories, and history will continue to do so. GT: You have visited Shenzhen twice and have praised the ""Shenzhen speed."" The capital of Cambodia, Phnom Penh, has long been a sister city with Shenzhen. Most of the ongoing projects in Cambodia's largest economic zone — the Sihanoukville Special Economy Zone (SSEZ) — are also invested by Chinese companies. In recent years, many livelihood projects under the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation mechanism have brought new development opportunities to the local people. How do these practices reflect the concept in this book of ""taking actions that will win their heart and support?"" Chea: There is an ancient Chinese saying: ""It is better to teach a man to fish than to give him a fish."" The practice of the Chinese approach in Cambodia has always embodied the wisdom of ""teaching a man to fish."" The Belt and Road Initiative is a vivid practice of China supporting Cambodia's socio-economic development, especially through the successful construction of the SSEZ, which draws on Shenzhen's experience and has directly or indirectly improved the living standards of the Cambodian people. This is vividly illustrated in the book: ""The programs of development will be open and inclusive, not exclusive. They will be a real chorus comprising all countries along the routes, not a solo for China itself."" A Cambodian proverb says, ""Where there is a road, there is hope."" In May 2024, Cambodian government announced the naming of a ring road encircling parts of the capital Phnom Penh as ""Xi Jinping Boulevard"" to express gratitude for the historic contribution the Chinese president has made to promoting Cambodia's development. We can clearly perceive that, under the care and promotion of the leaders of both countries, the people of the two nations are moving toward the ""road of hope.""",48:00.0,NewsData.io India Top,top,Unknown,https://en.prnasia.com/story/486061-0.shtml,

Atishi criticized the BJP for ""splitting"" AAP's councillors to increase their numbers, which she claims tilted the balance in the BJP’s favor. She also highlighted how the BJP has been pressuring AAP’s councillors over the past two and a half years, encouraging defections to their side. Despite these challenges, AAP claims that it achieved a majority in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) elections, despite efforts by the BJP to delay the elections and limit the number of wards. Atishi emphasized that AAP does not engage in ""buying"" or ""splitting"" elected representatives, as alleged by the BJP. She reiterated that AAP respects the will of the people and does not resort to underhanded methods.

966,Who Is US Second Lady Usha Vance? Know Her India Connection,"US Vice President JD Vance is visiting India with his wife, Usha Vance and their children — Ewan, Vivek, and Mirabel. Indian origin Usha Vance has been with next to her husband throughout his political career.While a lot is known about JD Vance, as the second lady of the United States, Usha Vance occupies a role that has traditionally remained in the background of White House affairs, which aligns with her low profile.Family & EducationAccording to BBC, Usha Vance was born and brought up in the working-class suburbs of San Diego, California. Her father worked as a mechanical engineer, while her mother, a molecular biologist, had immigrated to the United States from Andhra Pradesh, India. Meanwhile, her younger sister is a mechanical engineer with a semiconductor company in San Diego, and one of her aunts is a medical professional in Chennai.She earned a BA in history from Yale University and later became a Gates Scholar at Cambridge University, where she completed an MPhil in early modern history.According to New18, Usha Vance, in an interview, mentioned that she grew up in a religious household. “My parents are Hindu, and that is one of the things that made them such good parents, that made them really good people. And so I have seen the power of that.""How JD Vance met UshaUsha met JD Vance in 2010 while studying at Yale Law School, the two connected through a student discussion group focused on ""social decline in white America.""US VP Vance in his 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy, about his childhood in the white working-class US Rust Belt, wrote how he ""fell hard"" for Usha at Yale, describing her as a ""genetic anomaly"" because she possessed so many ideal qualities.ALSO READ: US Vice Prez JD Vance Lands In Delhi On 1st Official Visit To India Amid Tariff TensionsClassmates recall Usha Vance as someone who stood out in the intense, competitive environment of Ivy League law school—not just for her intellect, but for her kindness and readiness to help others.Political LeaningsHowever, Usha Vance’s political leanings had sparked considerable speculation.While her husband has vocally opposed what he calls “woke” ideologies promoted by Democrats, as per BBC she was a registered Democrat as recently as ten years ago. Up until the summer of 2023, she worked as a trial lawyer at the San Francisco-based firm Munger, Tolles & Olson, a firm known for its self-described “radically progressive” stance.She continued her work at the firm between clerkships, where, according to an archived version of her employee biography, she handled “complex civil litigation and appeals” in fields such as “higher education, local government, entertainment, and technology, including semiconductors”, according to BBC.Usha Vance resigned from her position after her husband, JD Vance, was named the Republican vice-presidential candidate.",56:19.0,NewsData.io India Top,top,ABP Live News,https://news.abplive.com/news/india/who-is-usha-vance-first-indian-american-hindu-second-lady-of-us-1766714,https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2025/04/21/7ab4e40ffc6badfee6a4342d2244eb5e174521706944419_original.jpg

974,Fake Google Emails Are Fooling Gmail Users: Here’s How to Stay Safe,"Gmail users are being targeted in an alarmingly convincing phishing scam that leverages real Google email addresses and cloned support pages to steal login credentials. What makes this particular scam dangerous is its ability to bypass standard security checks, making the emails look like they're genuinely from Google.The scam came into the spotlight after software developer Nick Johnson shared his experience on X (formerly Twitter).Recently I was targeted by an extremely sophisticated phishing attack, and I want to highlight it here. It exploits a vulnerability in Google's infrastructure, and given their refusal to fix it, we're likely to see it a lot more. Here's the email I got: pic.twitter.com/tScmxj3um6— nick.eth (@nicksdjohnson) April 16, 2025He received an email from the verified address no-reply@google.com alleging a subpoena had been issued for his Google account data. The message included a link that looked like an official Google support page — but clicking it led to a meticulously cloned Google sign-in page hosted on a subdomain of Google itself.Even Google's own security checks were trickedWhat sets this phishing campaign apart is that it cleverly navigates past authentication protocols like DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), which are meant to flag suspicious messages. Even more troubling is the fact that the fraudulent message appeared in the same Gmail thread as legitimate security alerts from Google, increasing the odds that users would trust it.Once on the fake sign-in page, users were prompted to “protest” the alleged subpoena, but any credentials entered would go straight into the attackers’ hands, giving them full access to the victim’s emails and personal data.Google confirms the threat, urges users to actGoogle has confirmed the phishing attack, stating that it “exploited OAuth and DKIM mechanisms in a novel way.” The company added that it is “rolling out protections” to address the issue and expects them to be “fully deployed” soon.In the meantime, Google is encouraging all users to strengthen their account security by enabling two-factor authentication and switching to passkeys, which are harder for attackers to steal.How to protect yourself right nowWhile Google works on a fix, users are strongly advised to avoid clicking on links in unexpected or unsolicited emails, even if they appear to come from Google. The safest course of action is to visit the official Google website directly and log in from there to check for any real alerts.This incident serves as a stark reminder that even tech giants' own platforms can be manipulated for phishing. Until the security patch is fully rolled out, a little extra scepticism and a few more clicks could be the difference between staying safe and losing control of your account.",53:50.0,NewsData.io India Technology,technology,Shayak Majumder,https://news.abplive.com/technology/gmail-scam-alert-phishing-how-to-stay-safe-1766715,https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2025/04/21/687a9746a1f1642a77b6d9112fbd99841745218237274402_original.jpg
